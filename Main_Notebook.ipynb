For the US, this is the median of the upper and lower target range (which differ by .25 points).  The most relevant interest rate, the main refinancing operations rate, was not available for the mid-2000s. Instead we used the median of the rate paid to banks for deposits into the ECB and the rate on marginal lending.  The main refinancing operations always lies between these two rates and follows the same trend.\n",

        "* *effective_ffr*:  The market federal funds rate on the first day of the month of the meeting.  When setting policy, the fed is trying to influence this interest rate.
